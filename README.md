# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

Welcome to the Spotify Song Popularity Prediction project readme! 

In this project, we will work with a sample of 10,000 records from the "Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 600k+ Tracks," available on Kaggle. Our goal is to predict the popularity of songs on the Spotify platform, which is represented as a float ranging from 0 to 100.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

**Numerical Columns:**
- `popularity`: Popularity of the song (target variable).
- `duration_ms`: Duration of the song in milliseconds.
- `explicit`: Whether the song is explicit (contains swearing or inappropriate language).
- `danceability`: Ranges from 0 to 1, representing how suitable a song is for dancing.
- `energy`: Ranges from 0 to 1, measuring the energy of the song.
- `loudness`: Loudness of the song, typically ranging from -60 to 0.
- `speechiness`: Ranges from 0 to 1, measuring the presence of spoken words in the song.
- `acousticness`: Ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the acoustic nature of the song.
- `instrumentalness`: Ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the instrumental nature of the song.
- `liveness`: Ranges from 0 to 1, measuring the presence of a live audience in the song.
- `valence`: Ranges from 0 to 1, representing the musical positiveness conveyed by the song.
- `tempo`: Tempo of the song, typically ranging from 50 to 150.

**Categorical Columns (string types):**
- `explicit`: Whether the song is explicit (contains swearing or inappropriate language).

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for model building. This includes:

- Dropping unnecessary columns such as `name`, `artists`, `id`, and others.
- Converting the `release_date` to a datetime format and extracting the year.
- Standardizing the numerical features.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Building

In this project, we explore several regression models, including:

- **Linear Regression**: A basic model to establish a benchmark.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Using polynomial features to capture more complex relationships.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method for regression.
- **XGBoost Regressor**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm.

### Model Evaluation

We evaluate our models using various metrics, including:

- **R-squared (R2) Score**: Measures the proportion of the variance explained by the model.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Provides the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Evaluates the percentage difference between predicted and actual values.

### Model Tuning

We perform hyperparameter tuning for the XGBoost Regressor and Random Forest Regressor to optimize their performance.
